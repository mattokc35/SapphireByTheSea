## Sapphire By The Sea (Next.js)

This is a full-stack direct booking site I built for Sapphire By The Sea, a beachhouse short-term rental in Crystal Beach, TX.

I built this project with Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Material UI, Stripe, Node.js, and Express.

The frontend is hosted on Vercel with SSR and Static Generation optimizations for improved SEO and rendering performance, and the backend is hosted on Render.
